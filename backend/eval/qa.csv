Josiah Lawson mural on the D Street Neighborhood Center wall across from Cal Poly Humboldt entrance. Painted by the muralist Ben Goulart and community , including Charmaine Lawson.",5,"The context explicitly provides the information that the Josiah Lawson mural was painted by the muralist Ben Goulart and the community, including Charmaine Lawson. Therefore, the question can be answered accurately from the given context.",4,"The question is relevant to Humboldt County as it pertains to a specific artwork located within the county, providing valuable historical or cultural information. However, the usefulness would greatly depend on the context and the importance of the mural in Humboldt County's art or cultural heritage. If the mural holds local significance, the question would be deemed more relevant than if it were solely of academic interest regarding the artist's work broadly.",4,"To answer the question, knowledge about the mural at the D Street Neighborhood Center and its painter, Josiah Lawson, is required. It does not rely on extensive additional context.","John Alcorn

The mural, ""Down the Tracks,"" painted on the D Street Neighborhood Center's wall, was created by John Alcorn, an artist known for his powerful, community-focused murals that often depict African American history and culture."

Isaac Minor

J essie I .  Minor I aters,  daughter  (1910);  Clearie s.  Reed  (1913);  Alice M•  Hill (1920);  Edna  McNeil (1939)

Ben  Feuerwerker  (1960)

Isaac Minor,  born in TJniontown,  Pennstlvania  in 1830,  was  drawn  to catifornia in 1851  by  the discovery  of gol d. After two  years  of 1.msuccessful mining near Sacramento,  he came  to Union  (Arcata) and  took  a  job digging potatoes  fol'.' captain Isaac Nixon  on  the  Nixon  farm  in the Arcata Bottans. Because  the packing business was  flourishing at the  time,  Minor purchased sane mules,  opened  a  stOTe  at Orleans,  and  established himself as  a  supplier for  the miners.  In 1855  he ma1;'.'ried capt.  Nixon's daughter,  Hannah,  and  they established their hane  in Arcata. There were twelve Minor children,  six of whan  grew  to adulthooD.

In 1859 Minor moved  his  family to C&mp  Anderson on  Redwood  Creek  where he  engaged  in stoc1,  raising, Difficulties between  whites  and  Indian people finally f orced  them  back  to Arcata and  the Minor farm. Packing and  fanning, however,  didn't seen  to be Minor's forte and  in 1864-65  he went  i nto partnership wit h  Noah  Falk and  built 't he  Oolly Varden mill  on  Janes  Creek  near  Camp  Curtis. In  time  they built the Jolly Giant mill  closer to town  and  in 1881  Minor built the Warren Creek mill.  A newspaper  article dated August 15,  1885  refers  to the construction of a  mill by Minor  on  Hall's creek near Glendale and  the expenditure of $50 1 000  on  the  project.

Minor's successes  in timber provided him  with  capital  for  other business ventures-the Warren Creek  standard gauge  railroad,  a  skating rink in Arcata, t he  Jacoby  Creek  quarry whiCh  provided roek  for  t he  jetti,es  at  the bay's entrance.,  the  Arcata  Kl.ecttlc co.  which  gave  Arcata  residents  their first electric lights i n  1895,  the First National  Bank  of Arcata of which  he was president  (built in 1913,  present  Open  Door  Clinic),  the Minor Theatre  (1914), 1 and  on  and  on. In 189ft  he  started  the little town north  of Arcata with  a  store, areamery and  several  houses. Named  for  the  President he much  admired, McKinleyville still boasts the L.o.  Graeter store which  was  run by Minor's daughter and  her husband.

Minor purchased the north  half  of  block  208  f ran c.c.  Richards  in 1876. The  house  that  became  Mi nor's  heme  (southwest corner of 11th and  H)  had  been built by  Geor ge  Tilley probably i n he  early 1870's·  Minor remodeled  and added  t o  the  house,  making  it into a  rather fine-looking  han.e. A portion  of the house  stands  to the rear  of the C nclini  buildi ng.

The  date  of construction for  the  Feuerwerker house  is estimated to be about 188'.based on  type  of archit·ecture and  assessment records  and  supported by  the econa:nic  boan  of  that  tune. Assessment records  for 1874  and 1875  fac George  Tilley list improvements  for  the north half of block 208  at $900. An 1883  assessment  f .or Isaac Minor shows  $700  worth  of improvements  for that same  !)t'operty. Records  for 1884  ar-e  not available,  but  those  for 1885  list improvements  at $2100.

The  Feuerwerket' house and  t he  house  directly to 'the north were  identical at the time  of  construction as  indicated by  pictures  taken near  the  turn  of the century. In my opinion,  the significance of these houses,  Minor's  home., and  the bt.mgalow  on  11th Stteet  (built in 1914  fTom  lumber  cut at the  Dolly Varden mill in the 1860's and  used  in the ,cookhouse)is  based  on  several  factors a 1) Isaac Mi nor,  himself,  w s  certainly one  of Humboldt  County .. s  most  pr ani nent and  able  develo ers and n  imporl:ant  partici a  t  in Arc  ta· history and  growth; 2)  the h  uses  ar e  part  of Minor's block which  includes  the Mi  or Theatre;  3)  the uni quen-ess  of  A,:cata·s  downtown  business  area  is enhanced  by  vestiges  of the past  and  the  l d  hanes  that  r ai n  n  ar  the aza are vit l  can  onents  to pres ervin this uni  ueness;  and  4)  the Towers  Restaurant  {built i n  1901  by James  Kirk an associate of  inor i n  the Uanen Creek mill ),  one  of Arcata·s fine  examples  of Queen  Anne  architectur,  is supported and  ccinplemented y the older buildings  near y.

## Kiera's Entry for Oral History

COVID-19 was very challenging for me. I enjoyed living in the dorms and staying on campus, it really helped me with my independence and focusing on school. It made me realize how I really enjoyed going to classes, being around people, having my own space, and socializing.

When COVID-19 hit, the campus was really empty and it was harder to stay on campus. All of my roommates have moved out and the lack of socialization was negatively impacting my mood.

Although I'm an introvert, I still enjoy seeing people in daily life because it helps me not feel as if I'm alone. With an empty campus, I barely passed by anyone and it made me realize how real and scary this pandemic was.

Moving back home was challenging, although I love my family, my environment is much louder and lacked quiet spaces so it's harder focusing on college and completing assignments in such a busy environment.

I also don't have many friends and since this is a harder period to make them and even be around people, this pandemic impacted my mental health.

Due to living far and being in a busy household, it is definitely challenging to stay connected to extracurricular activities and events for the school.

Sincerely, Kiera Price",5,"The context directly mentions Kiera Price's experience in remote Humboldt University during the Covid-19 pandemic and her challenges with socialization and returning home, unambiguously answering the question about her experiences during this time.",4,"This question pertains to Humboldt State University (HSU) and how it managed access during the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically mentioning Kiera Price's stance or actions regarding the pandemic. It is relevant for individuals looking for information on the educational and administrative actions taken by HSU in response to the pandemic, which is a significant event affecting academic and community documents within Humboldt County. However, the specificity and relevance could vary depending on the depth of detail sought – whether it's about policies, resources, or educational innovations implemented by HSU during the pandemic. The mention of Kiera Price adds a specific lens to the query, possibly indicating a focus on individual leadership actions or perspectives.",4,"The question relates to Humboldt State University (HSU) and its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically mentioning Kiera Price's perspective on the pandemic. Whether one knows the context that Kiera Price is a professor and consultant known for her public health expertise—or not—a connection to HSU during a significant public health crisis provides enough context to understand that the question is about the university's pandemic response strategies or policies. However, someone unfamiliar with HSU's structure, Kiera Price's role, or the pandemic's impact on educational institutions might find this question somewhat vague.","Kiera Price, a professor at Humboldt State University (HSU), explored the impact of the pandemic on students and staff in her talk at HSU. She emphasized the university’s support mechanisms, like mental health services and flexible learning options, showcasing HSU's resilience amid Covid-19 challenges. (37 words)"

The  prcnlaed wagon  road ·took  two yean to cc:aplete according to a  November 6,  1818  new a paper  (FG\111 tain,  33 · 36.6) ·

The  Garberville-Sbelter cove  wagon  road  was  caapleted frm the former  place to ita junotim with Secticm S  of tb· coast wagon  Toad  on  OCtober  30  and tU1:'lled ovtt to the Ccalisaian.

Prior to the con,t~cticm of the anceland B""tidge,  th· South  Fork  of the Eel  was  crossed,  near the pruent bridge lite, either by  fordlng the river during low  water or by  taklng the feffY· &ill  Louk,.  a  ferryman  and  urly Garberville aettler, said the first road from  Garberville  through Briceland to Shelter Cove  waa  l>Uilt  by  the Chln····  wh·e caap near Briceland vaa known as  China  Creek  Camp  (Huml)oldt  Times,  Sept.  3,  1950) ..

The context also discusses the events leading up to its potential washing away. Specific years and details about the completion make it clear.",4,"The question is relevant to historical documents related to the infrastructure of Humboldt County. The Briceland Bridge is a significant local landmark in the county, so questions about its construction timeline are pertinent to local historical records, particularly engineering and transportation documents. However, the direct relevance could hinge on the availability of detailed records relating specifically to when the original bridge was completed, which might not always be well-documented.",4,"The question asks for a specific year related to when the first Briceland Bridge was completed, which requires specific historical knowledge but is clearly outlined in the query. It's context-dependent only to the extent that one needs to know about the Briceland Bridge specifically, but the question doesn't rely on implicit understanding from outside knowledge about various bridges or multiple iterations of the Briceland Bridge completion.",The first Briceland Bridge was completed in **1925**.

The  fishermen provide Eureka with its second largest  industry. As  such,  the Mayor  and the  City Council should he  interested  in furthering the  fishing industry. But what has the present Mayor and Council done to help develop the  fishing industry in Eureka?

Other cities have provided the  fishermen with suitable docking space,  but  in Eureka the Fishermen have a makeshift  dock,  danger­ ous  to the  boats  in rough weather,  and providing a  fire hazard that might prove disastrous where boats  lay together three and four deep.

The  City could have dredging done at  very little  cost which would allow boats to come  in and  out  of the  inside  of the dock in low water.  A survey could be made  of the  cost  of building a bulk­ head on the shoreline,  arrangements made  for permission or a lease from the NWP,  and plans worked  out  for the  improvement  of the  fish­ ing dock. But the present Mayor and Council will not  do things, according to their past record.

There are  other  issues  in this  campaign that  are  of interest to the  fishermen,  many of whom are  local residents and home  owners. Playgrounds and swimming pools  for the  children through the use  of funds and land which  could bo used  for that purpose.  More  equal taxes  for the  small home  owner. Improved streets,  sidewalks,  and transportation systems by the use of PWA and WPA grants  for the lowest possible  cost  to the taxpayers.

labor's  fundamental rights must  be  guaranteed to the  fisher­ men. This right  to the union fishermen is also to the  interest  of the  Co-op  fishermen,  because  the price paid to the union fishermen will to a great  extent  determine the price that the  Co-op  fisher­ men will receive. The present Mayor and  City Council will not pro­ tect  these  rights. Me Dade,  Larson,  and  Schulze were  in  office  in 1935 when civil rights  completely broke down,  and they did nothing to guarantee the  fundamental rights  to union men in the  City.

Albert  J.  ""Mickie' Lima will work for the  interests  of the Eureka fishermen,  and will work to  improve the  docking facilities of the  fish wharf.

ATTEND THE PEOPLE'S PROGRAM PARTY, 1418 A STREET,  SATURDAY NIGHT 8 P.M.

## VOTE FOR ALBERT ""MICKIE"" LIJMA

QUALIFICATIONS:

Age 31. Born in Mendcino County,  he  came to Humboldt with his  family in 1915. He has resided  in Eureka for the past  four years. Received his  education at Humboldt  State  and at the Uni­ versity of California where ho studied  economics and business administration.

Lima  is  familiar with the  Ordinances  of the  City of Eureka, having worked  in the  City Hall  on a WPA project,  rewriting,  re­ vising and reindexing the  Ordinances.  He helped draw up a new li­ cense  ordinance which would have  eliminated the  inequalities  ex­ isting in the present  one,  but which was  turned down by the Mayor.

Believing that  strong trade unions are  one  of the  best  guar­ antees  of preserving democratic  government,  Lima has been active in union affairs,  having helped  organize  several locals  of the lumber workers and the Workers Alliance.

Lima has been a member  of the  Communist Party since 1936.

## FACULTY SPOTLIGHT:

## Dr. Meredith Williams

Professor of Sociology, Sociology Graduate Program Coordinator

##  How long have you been at HSU? Can you tell us about your academic history?

WILLIAMS: ' I am just finishing up my fourth year at HSU. Along with Dr. Renée Byrd, I was hired to start the new Criminology and Justice Studies major in the Department of Sociology. Prior to working here, I

<!-- image -->

completed my PhD at Washington State University in 2013. I took and taught classes at the main campus in Pullman, and a satellite campus in Vancouver, WA. That is also where I completed my bachelors degree. All of my degrees are in Sociology, with specializations in gender and crime.'

##  What kind of research are you involved with?

WILLIAMS: 'Most recently, I have been working with Dr. Joice Chang from the Department of Politics, and an amazing team of undergraduate and graduate students, to interview LGBTQ adults. We are exploring a 'queer life course,' or the life trajectories of LGBTQ adults, to see if and how they get involved in crime.'

##  Are any students involved in your research?

WILLIAMS: 'I have students involved in all of my research projects. I fell in love with research by working as a research assistant for professors when I was a student, and hope I can inspire some students to get more involved in the research world. I like to show students they are more capable of research than they might think they are, and I like to push them to find their own questions and voice as a scholar. I still work with former students from other universities on some of my research projects; I love that I get to stay connected to my former students long after they leave my class.'

##  What is your favorite part of your job?

WILLIAMS: 'One day I will say I find teaching to be the most rewarding aspect of my job, then the next I will say it's the research. As faculty, we are pretty lucky-we get to teach and learn new things every day. And, as much as I love both teaching and research, I also like working behind the scenes. I like creating resources, and contributing to a campus culture, to help students achieve their goals.'

##  How do you spend your time outside of HSU?

WILLIAMS: 'My wife Janae and I love to visit new places, try new food, and experience new adventures. We are always looking for the next place to go or thing to see. When not adventuring, I love to read young adult literature and compare notes with my 20+ nieces and nephews.'

##  Do you have any advice for current or prospective students?

WILLIAMS: 'You belong here. When the imposter syndrome starts sneaking in, trying to convince you that you aren't good enough, ignore it. Ask for help. Graduate school is hard, and sometimes you feel like you shouldn't show weakness or confusion. What you may not know is that others are feeling the same way. Talk to each other, and your professors, and try out all the amazing resources we have all over campus-we are all here to help you to be successful.'

Emily Cooper is a graduate student in

the Natural Resources Masters program. Emily's research seeks to quantify the anadromous salmonid habitat in the upper Eel River watershed that is currently blocked to fish migration by Scott Dam. The results will answer whether river restoration via dam modification or removal is necessary for the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations in the Eel River watershed. This project aims to deliver evidence to inform the upcoming relicensing of Scott

Dam, whose process begins in 2017.

This is extremely timely and relevant to the management of water and fish in the Eel River watershed.  She is the recipient

of the 2015-16 CSU COAST Graduate Student Research Award and the WRPI Water Resources Internship and has received support from CalTrout and the (NMFS).

I n the spring of 2019, a series of equity-based, world café style open-forums were held with the goal of improving the community-based learning experience for students at Cal Poly Humboldt. It became evident that extra costs to participate in these experiences (gas, testing fees, background checks) were causing /financial hardship for many students, and for some, fees became a barrier to participation altogether. In response, the Center for Community Based Learning (CCBL) developed a program to o/ffer mini-grants to help students complete community-based learning experiences.

In the summer of 2019, CCBL was awarded a Loyalty grant of $10,000 to help students with community-based learning costs for the 2019/2020 academic year. Due to the success of the Loyalty Grant program, the mini-grant program was expanded in 2020 by tapping into available GI2025 funding. As of February, 2022, 346 additional students have bene/fited from the award. '/T\_hank you so much for your help with my school expenses,' responded one student to the news of their $250 award.

/T\_he GI2025-funded Community Based Learning (CBL) Mini-Grant program provides assistance to all students participating in community-based learning, including teaching and clinical experiences, who experience /financial hardship due to their o/ff-campus placements. Awards of up to $250 are provided to eligible students on a /first-come, /first-served basis each semester to provide support with onboarding and completion expenses related to /field placement.

/T\_his program reduces /financial barriers and increases equitable access to these high impact practices for students at Cal Poly Humboldt. According to the 2021/2022 data, 12% of students would /find participation 'more di/fficult' without the award, and 9% of students report that they would simply not be able to participate without the additional /financial support.

To date, the response from students has been overwhelmingly positive. '/T\_hank you so much for the generous grant. It means a lot to me and will help me reach my goal of becoming an elementary school teacher this time next year!' reported a CBL Mini-Grant student recipient.

## Beyond the Impact: Traumatic Brain Injuries and Long-Term Association with Neurodegenerative Diseases

Andrea Lugo California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt

## Overview

This review examines the relationship between traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) while highlighting the critical role of proteins tau and beta-amyloid in TBI-related neurodegeneration while calling for more research on treatment strategies.

Keywords : Traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, protein accumulation, neuropathology

## Introduction

- · TBI as a precursor to neurodegenerative diseases, causing lasting cellular and molecular brain changes. [2]
- · Link between TBI history and higher Alzheimer's risk, with CTE as a dementia subtype from repetitive injury. [3]
- · Research focused on TBI's chronic effects and the quest for treatments to mitigate long-term brain injury consequences.

<!-- image -->

Figure 1 . Various outcomes from traumatic brain injuries lead to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia [10]

## Discussion

## Chronic traumatic brain inflammation

- · Neuroinflammation features prominently in central nervous system disorders, like TBI, with cytokine release and microglial activation seen in 28% of patients after one year. [2]
- · Chronic TBI results in brain atrophy and cell loss, as demonstrated with microglia activation patterns observed in the brains of TBI patients. [3]

## Alzheimer's Disease

- · TBI significantly increases the risk of AD by affecting key proteins (APP, ApoE, Tau) involved in neuron integrity, which when altered, can lead to protein aggregates that disrupt brain function. [9]
- · Studies show 30% of TBI fatalities have AD's amyloid plaques; a history of TBI doubles AD dementia risk, with factors like axonal injury and genetic variants like ApoE4 influencing the severity. [10]
- · CTE is linked to repetitive brain injuries often seen in contact sports and military service with post-mortem exams showing global brain atrophy and tau protein accumulation in resemblance to Alzheimer's disease. [7]

## Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy

- · CTE's progression is staged from isolated tau protein deposits in early stages to widespread neurofibrillary pathology in most brain regions in advanced stages, as demonstrated in neuropathological research. [7]

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2. Staging of Tau pathology in CTE [7]

- · Stage I CTE: Limited p-tau in cortex, mainly superior and frontal areas, around blood vessels in sulci.
- · Stage II CTE: Multiple p-tau centers in sulci, spreading to adjacent cortex surfaces; medial temporal lobe unaffected.
- · Stage III CTE: Broad p-tau spread in major brain cortices and key areas like amygdala and hippocampus.
- · Stage IV CTE: Extensive severe p-tau throughout most cortical regions, including medial temporal lobe; calcarine cortex usually spared.

## Figure 3. [6]

B) 36-year-old female, no TBI : Minimal immunoreactivity, microglia highly ramified.

C) 92-year-old female, no TBI: Numerous microglia, visible signs of activation with hypertrophy and shortened processes.

D-E) Ages 23 and 31 males, 4 weeks post-TBI: Activated microglia clusters with decreased ramification

F-H) Ages 43, 67, and 64 males, various years post-TBI (4 years to 16 years): Extensive amoeboid microglia with minimal or no processes, densely packed

<!-- image -->

Single or repeated TBI initiates a series of complex biochemical mechanisms and multifactorial pathobiology. These biochemical mechanisms can lead to chronic neurodegeneration accompanied by delayed chronic neuropsychiatric changes. The biochemical mechanisms and pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and chronic traumatic brain inflammation following TBI are demonstrated.

<!-- image -->

## Future Directions

- · Research related to TBI and its long-term neuropathologies is still in its infancy, major gaps persists in understanding its link to neurodegenerative diseases.
- · Need for more data on TBI's long-term effects and development of accurate biomarkers.
- · Future studies should factor in genetics, severity of injury and cognitive reserve to gauge neurodegeneration risk.

## Conclusion

The chronic cascade of TBIs play out heterogeneously and are highly personalized within a framework of common neuropathological features and clinical symptoms of classically defined neurodegenerative disorders.

Although central nervous system (CNS) disorders post-TBI are common, there are minimal treatment options to halt the pathologic progression that is believed to culminate in chronic neurological conditions.

Robust epidemiological evidence positions TBI as a significant risk factor for neurodegenerative conditions and should drive the development of interventions to improve patient outcomes.

It highlights the role of proteins tau and beta-amyloid in the neurodegeneration process following a traumatic brain injury. While it does not explicitly answer the question 'what role does the protein tau play in neurodegeneration caused by TBI?' in a sentence or two, it provides a comprehensive framework that allows for a clear inference that tau plays a critical role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases after TBI, evidenced by its accumulation in the brains of patients with TBI, which is particularly notable in the context of CTE. The discussion of Staging of Tau pathology in CTE further elucidates how tau pathology progresses through stages (from limited cortical tau deposits to widespread neurofibrillary pathology) indicating a direct role of tau in TBI-related neuronal damage and eventual neurodegeneration.

## INTERGENERATIONAL CONNECTIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY: AN OLD FASHIONED GREEN MOVEMENT IN A NEW WORLD

BY MYRANDA FELTON

I n the city of Eureka, right o/ff the freeway and down Tydd Street, there is a tall building surrounded by native flowers and trees. To the right of the building there is a small garden, greenhouse and compost pile. On its other side is a painted wooden sign that marks the beginning of 'Mary's Garden.' This surprisingly lush place, in the middle of a concrete jungle, is Silvercrest Eureka. This independent living facility is for low income seniors. This is where Eileen Bell, a social worker at Silvercrest, can be found juggling the lives of multiple residents most days in her o/ffice. Clean and tidy, one would never guess the insurmountable pile of work Bell faces. The source of her toil is the one hundred and fifty residents that rely on her expertise. Each resident at Silvercrest has their own struggles and stories that need tending to, and yet, not many of them have an outlet. We find Bell dealing with an amalgamation

of these issues as I interview her on a Wednesday evening.

## This surprisingly lush place, in the middle of a concrete jungle, is Silvercrest Eureka.

I have come to ask the social worker how she thinks we can create a more sustainable society. I know that Bell is a strong advocate for intergenerational connections as a green practice. Intergenerational connections are interactions between people of di/fferent generations. This is a frequently discussed topic in the world of Silvercrest, but not many other places. 'The division in our culture is very stark and very dangerous,' Bell begins, 'statistically, over twenty percent of our population is going to be over sixty five in the next couple of years.'

She turns to her computer, likely having just remembered another 'over sixtyfive-year-old' who had been trying to get in touch with her today. After a few seconds she begins again, 'We are so focused on innovation and not how we got here. And this can destroy a civilization.' Seniors at Silvercrest are good examples of the troubling statistics in Humboldt County. Each year,over thirty people die of suicide in this County; theirages range from forty to sixty. BMC Public Health also says that 'Approximately 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk of social isolation and one-third will experience some degree of loneliness later in life.' The rest of the population is su/ffering right alongside this age group. Bell had told me earlier, 'We have a line of depressed, lonely seniors hoping to get in'' at all times.

I couldn't help but wonder, looking over these statistics, how we can help the entire population, while also worrying

about the health of the environment for future generations. Yet, our ever-multitasking social worker knew how to tackle the first issue. She let me know that the Silvercrest population has made remarkable strides in their mental health with the implementation of interns from Cal Poly Humboldt. Social Work majors and College Corp fellows have been invited to participate in all Silvercrest events and activities this year. The age range for interns usually extends from eighteen to twenty-four, and they bring a new kind of energy to the building. It seems that the Harvard School of Psychology has noticed a similar phenomenon. Researchers at Harvard found that people sixty five and older have 'higher levels of energy with increased connections.'

In a study for 2019, researchers  connected these higher levels of energy with longer lifespans, which is well-known to stem from decreased depressive episodes. In addition to this, elderly with more connections have less depressive symptoms and have an improved sense of community. I couldn't help but think that this would give them more reason to contribute towards a better community. Thus, a good community would have more intergenerational connections and more intergenerational connections

would create an even better community. Not to mention that healthier seniors are able to bring their retirement money into more passion projects rather than hospital bills. This would bring an inflow of money to the local community as seniors have increased needs for housing, transportation and other services. As Bell said, 'Looking at it from a fiscal perspective, taking care of the people who raised us, saves millions of dollars in hospital fees.' Not only that but 'People over the age of fifty are a big voter population.'

Within this line of thinking, Bell agrees that a happier senior can be an untapped source of potential for environmental advocacy. In our fast-paced society, leisure time is a privilege, not a right. A healthy senior will have more leisure time than the average American. Mary Martinson of the Oxford University Press states that older adults have 'higher civic engagement and volunteerism.' Not to mention that older people can be models for generational knowledge on tending to the land. They can also be good advocates for resilience, which younger generations will certainly need living through the present climate crisis. The elderly are also more likely to take up gardening as a hobby.

Silvercrest seniors contribute to a community garden, which in turn feeds other food insecure seniors at their facility and patients at the OpenDoor clinic. This generates virtually no emissions, as food is walked from garden to apartment. Bell celebrates their e/fforts saying, 'They're not a burden to society, they're action-makers.' The residents command any volunteers who walk through the garden. When I went to visit they were hard at work, harvesting large bundles of kale. They were excited to be there and were even happy to proclaim that Cal Poly Humboldt students helped inspire them to keep volunteering. It seems that new senior volunteers, who had never been to the garden, came down to work. It seemed to me they had been invigorated by the students. Although this change is small-scale, intergenerational connections have virtually no downsides and all positive outcomes. If we were to give back to our community by supporting our elders, they can potentially support the youth in fighting this climate crisis locally.

They're not a burden to society, they're action-makers.

As I pack up to leave Bell's o/ffice, she has a resident emergency to tend to, she ends our interview by stating 'Normalizing our relationships with our elders, economically and culturally heals our communities.' It is as simple as that. Healthy communities create  healthy environments and seniors are at the forefront of that. Walking out of the building, I see seniors still sitting in the garden, pulling weeds. They are happy and chatting in the rare bit of sunshine that Humboldt weather provides. It seems that this organic garden is a small bit of utopia that scholars have been searching for to take over our concrete cities. As I walk across the street, I see the free produce table standing in the clinic, free for all patients. It amazes me that organic produce grown by seniors could help another needy populus. Eileen had said that 'We' tend to 'assume new is good.' This applies to so much we undervalue in our society; outdated products, reused materials, and the older people in our community. Maybe we can improve our lifestyles with help from another generation. Maybe we can finally stop pushing the burden of climate change to future generations and instead have past generations shoulder some of the load.

If you or anyone you know is interested in seeing these wonderful seniors and helping them to garden their organic produce, they can be found at the OpenDoor Community Garden in Eureka, California. Volunteers will find the garden across the street from the OpenDoor Clinic at  2200 Tydd St. Or call the clinic to ask them about their volunteers at: (707) 441-1624. Online contact can be made through their Facebook @OpenDoorComunity&WellnessGarden.

## Volunteer Information:

Volunteer hours are on Thursdays from 10:00 A.M. to 12:00 A.M. If you are not able to make their volunteer hours, consider contacting Jessie Holtz at the OpenDoor Gardens during volunteer hours. Jessie Holtz aids in physical activities surrounding volunteer days, and is responsible for the safe environment provided for the senior citizens. The garden volunteers appreciate any extra help that can be provided.

## Bird Diversity in Arcata, California: A Study on Urban Influence

Brittany Ocheltree bmo28@humboldt.edu Department of Wildlife, Cal Poly Humboldt, 1 Harpst Street, Arcata, CA 95521, USA

## Introduction

- · Urbanization is a primary driver of native species loss [1].
- · In the past 50 years, the U.S. alone has seen a 29% decline in bird abundance [2].
- · This study aimed to assess how building density influences urban bird communities within Arcata.
- · Hypothesis: As building density increases, nonnative species abundance will increase. Overall bird diversity will also decrease with increased building density.

## Study Area

- · Arcata is wedged between a vast coastal redwood forest, and a narrow range of pastureland, with the Arcata Marsh and Humboldt Bay in the southwest [3].
- · Common species: Gulls, Crows, Ravens, Steller's Jay, House Sparrows, European Starlings, Rubycrowned Kinglet, Wrentit, Winter Wren, Yellowrumped Warbler, Bushtit, and American Robin.

## Methods

- · Fixed radius 75m point counts for 10 mins, within 30 randomly selected study sites, using ArcGIS.
- · Recorded bird species, abundance of birds, and building density by counting the number in all cardinal directions.
- · To determine if there is a relationship between building density and bird species native and nonnative status, I used a chi-squared formula [4].
- · A linear regression model was used to compare Shannon diversity to building density (n = 30) [5].

'Our Own Country' was published as a 'weekly magazine of fine arts' beginning with Series 1, no. 1, March 12, 1894 and continued at least up to Series 1, no. 20, July 23, 1894.  At least one of the issues is noted to have 16 pages.  If we assume all had 16 pages, then p. 127 would be in no. 8, published April 30, 1894.  The book, 'Our Own Country' was published in 1894 and is what was digitalized by Google.  It must have been late in 1894 and no. 20 may have been the last issue published.  This would all make sense as the digitalized book has 320 pages (16 pages x 20 issues = 320 pages).  It was published again in 1913 as a revised edition.  Both of these publications are available on ABE Books for about $150.  One of the images in the book, on page 97, identified as a 'Digger' Indian was published in Overland Monthly in August, 1893, (attributed to Ericson) which, to me, suggests that many/all of the images may have been available before 1894, and given the delays between writing and publishing, may have been available in 1892.  How Cox came about them is not known to me.  The fact that so many of them are mistakenly captioned suggests that Cox did not obtain them from the sale at the conclusion of the World's Fair as I would think that Ericson's stamp and/or identifying caption or logo would have been present below the image or on the verso of the photo.  Peter acknowledges that many of Ericson's photos were used in a variety of places without credit being given.  Copies of images could have been widely circulated and used without credit being given with little recourse by the photographer.

'Happy Indian Family' Missionary and civilizing work among the Indians is not always a failure, and we have here a pleasing illustration of the good results which are sometimes attained. Both the man and woman have adopted the clothes of their white relations, and although neither of them has acquired that difficult art of wearing good clothes well, each shows a desire to conform, as far as in them lies to the edicts of Ward McAllister. [Wikipedia. Ward McAllister, self-appointed arbiter of New York society, 1860s-1890s. Said to become a tastemaker among New York society's 'Knickertocracy;' snobbish society's schoolmaster] The children have before them at least a prospect of growing up as useful citizens, although the baby is being treated to a liberal dose of the peculiar idea of dress which has prevailed for generations. The features of the members of our happy Indian family should be scrutinized, and the effect of civilization and refinement on the younger members used as an argument in refutation of the claim so frequently made that the only way to reform an Indian is to shoot him.

Online: Technically, Native Americans received the right to vote in 1870 with passage of 15 th amendment. However, it wasn't until 1924 with passage of Indian Citizenship Act in which Congress granted citizenship to Native Americans that they began exercising their right to vote.",4,"The context does not cite a specific publisher, but it mentions that the 'Our Own Country' book was published by the Imperial Publishing Co., St. Louis, Missouri in 1894 based on details from Google's digitization and further information from Peter Palmquist’s research.

C. McDonald pertains to Humboldt County as it provides a historical look into the county's early development. This information can be valuable for researchers or individuals interested in the historical documents and literature of Humboldt County.,4,"The question is asking for the publishing entity of a specific book titled 'Our Own Country' published in 1894.

## Stuck in the Dark

## By Naomi Harrison

I've felt the darkness before But not like this I'm alone, I'm void, I'm numb I can't feel the cold I've been in anymore And my tears are sinking into the ground.

I lie alone in this still black place I don't know why. There is pain of a different sort That I've ever experienced. At least in this life.

There is no warm to this nothingness

No heat or light or joy

All there is is

Black

Cold

Nothing

There's a void where my heart where used to be

And it's sucking me in

A black hole of my own design.

I try to claw at my chest, but -

I can't move.

I'm stuck in this pit of evil

I'm stuck with the voices in my head

I'm stuck with the realization that I have failed

I've lost everything.

Everything.

A ray of light bursts through my memory-

Someone opens the door.

A friend I've never thought

Could be there for me.

They embrace me.

Could the words they're whispering be true?

Am I worth anything?

Am I more than just a shadow on the ground?

Am I alive and… possible?

Am I loved?

Are there people out there who think of me

And don't cringe?

Are there people who love me for who I am?

No

It can't be.

## Harrison: Stuck in the Dark

I'm such a terrible person.

I shouldn't exist.

But they don't think so.

My amazing friend who whispers words of comfort.

They… love… me

NO

IT CAN'T BE TRUE

I'M UNLOVABLE

I'M A HORRIBLE TERRIBLE CREATURE

And yet…

They say they are there for me.

They say they love me.

Are they lying, just to watch me suffer?

They know I hate this

Are they against me?

I don't know what to think

I can't think

This pain

This suffering

This wave that pulls me under

But my friend dives under with me

And holds my hand

And pulls me towards the shore

Tentatively, I follow.

They're all there

Everyone I know so well

The f aces I've lied to

But one face stands out

My

Friend

Maybe they don't all hate me

My friend tells me so softly

Is she with the darkness?

No

She practically bursts with light

She is my savior

My hero

My friend

She loves me for who I am

She doesn't judge

So I climb up the stairs

Swim to the surface

Claw my way up from the pits

My friend lights a candle to dispel the dark

Us in the dark

She shines with a light unconceivable

She understands

She is with me.

I love her too.

I tell her that.

## Harrison: Stuck in the Dark

So together we open the curtains To reveal the light of day It shines on me I am one with the light The darkness inside melts away

It coils down there, waiting to strike Waiting for its next victim I won't let it take me I WILL FIGHT! I am strong and brave

I am no longer stuck in the dark.",5,The poem provides a clear narrative and emotional journey that allows for an unambiguous assessment of the speaker's internal conflict and resolution. The progression from despair and self-hatred to hope and love through the intervention of a trusted friend is explicitly described within the context given.,4,"This question is relevant because it indicates an interest in public health resources which are official documents often associated with government entities like Humboldt County. A precise document relevant to this query would be health policies, public health records, or budget allocations concerning medical resources in the area. However, the question does not specify the type of document needed (e.g., reports, legal documents, etc.), which slightly lessens its utility.",5,"The question directly inquires about the functionality of something called 'pattern matching'. While 'pattern' might not be explicably defined in the context given, the question's focus on what task pattern matching is designed to accomplish is clear. Though a technical term, the inquiry does not depend on external context for understanding its intent.","Although Humboldt is globally recognized for its unique setting and diverse ecosystems, detailed demographic breakdowns for the locality can be gleaned from local government websites or statistical databases like the U.S. Census Bureau. These platforms offer comprehensive insights into the population, age distribution, and ethnic composition of Humboldt. It's important to note that more specific or recent data might be required for in-depth demographic studies. For the most current figures, direct inquiry with Humboldt's local authorities or their online portals is recommended.

## Mis Lugares Favoritos

By Alexis Santos Pacheco

Yo nací en Guanajuato México, pero ahora estoy viviendo en California, Estados Unidos. Mi casa en Guanajuato es mi lugar favorito, porque es mi primer hogar y es el lugar donde crecí durante doce años y medio. Tengo muchas experiencias ahí tanto buenas como malas, aunque algunas intento olvidar. Siempre que estoy ahí me siento muy libre para hacer muchas cosas que en otro lugar no puedo hacer, como manejar mi cuatrimoto. Mi padre tiene cerca de 16 hectáreas de terreno y esas 16 hectáreas de terreno mi padre, hermanos y yo las cultivamos con maíz, alfalfa, trigo, y avena. A pesar de que nunca nos faltaba la comida en la mesa, era una vida difícil porque a veces la cosecha no iba bien o se descomponía algo y teníamos que arreglarlo y es así como se acababa el dinero. Lo cierto es que, yo era feliz en México a pesar de todo, pero sentía que México no me ofrecía lo que yo estaba buscando, que era estudiar en una mejor escuela para algún día ser alguien importante como programador y productor de música.

Cuando nos mudamos a California fue impactante para mi porque todo era muy diferente como las casas, los árboles, el clima, y en general todo era diferente, además aquí si hay mar y donde yo vivía no hay. A mi me gusta mucho California porque desde pequeño siempre fue mi sueño vivir aquí, bueno realmente no me importaba el estado que fuera, solo quería vivir en estados unidos, pero ahora que estoy aquí no lo cambiaría por otro lugar porque ya es como mi segundo hogar. Mi lugar favorito en Humboldt- aun no lo he encontrado. Aunque hasta el momento mi lugar favorito ha sido mi cuarto, donde duermo y donde pasó la mayoría de mi tiempo. Siempre que estoy en mi cuarto me siento muy cómodo, especialmente cuando escucho música y veo anime.",4,"The context mentions Guanajuato, México as the birthplace of Alexis Santos Pacheco and discusses his life and experiences in both Guanajuato and California. It describes the difficulty of managing farmland and the dream of studying in the US for a better future. Although not explicitly stating every specific location Alexis has lived for 12.5 years (which could imply more varied places apart from Guanajuato and California), the primary focus is on Guanajuato as the place where he grew up for 12.5 years and the contrast with California where he now feels he found his second home.",4,"Alexis Santos Pacheco nació en 1985 en Tepic, Nayarit, México, pero se mudó a Humboldt County, California, con su familia cuando tenía doce años y medio. La información es relevante para aquellos interesados en la vida temprana de Alexis Santos Pacheco, pero es particularmente relevante en cuanto a su relación con el área geográfica mencionada, lo que hace que la pregunta sea específicamente útil para personas que quieran saber más sobre su historia personal relacionada con Humboldt County.
",5,La pregunta es específica sobre el lugar de crecimiento de una persona. No requiere contexto adicional para entenderla excepto el conocimiento básico de los términos utilizados. Se entiende claramente independientemente del contexto adicional.,"Creció en San Javier, una ciudad ubicada en la región de Baja California Sur, México. Alexis Santos Pacheco es originario de México."

## Mapping Lumberjacks

dr. amy rock

L ast fall, I was contacted by Marcom, Humboldt State University's marketing and communications department, about making a map of Humboldt alumni for a year-end publication. (I later discovered this was a calendar rather than a year-end report or magazine as I'd originally thought, so while I can't exactly say I'm a calendar girl, I can at least say my map may be hanging on walls across America...)  I was sent a spreadsheet of alumni counts by zipcode.  In past years, this map has been made using a technique called proportional symbols , which sizes the symbol to the number of alumni in that zip code.

When I tried that out, it looked like this: When I tried that out, it looked like this:

<!-- image -->

The first thing I noted, with delight, is that Lumberjacks are all across the United States. The second was that California looked like a mess. As a part of the California State University (CSU) system (and really symptomatic of state universities everywhere), the vast majority of our students come from, and remain in, California. So, while this map shows a nice spread across the country, and clusters in pretty much every major city, it really hides the story of what is happening in our home state.

In light of this geovisual problem, I decided to try out a valuable statistical technique called data binning , which is intended for just such a situation. Data bins, in this case hexagons, are created uniformly across the surface, and symbolized by the number of data points that fall within each bin. Not only did this demonstrate more clearly how Lumberjacks are spread within the density of the West Coast, but it gave me the opportunity to work in our school colors, green and gold. If

quotation marks around every mention of it. We decided to capitalize it because we are treating the Timber Wars as a series of discrete events that occurred in a particular region.

We started preparing this issue with a Call  for  Papers  asserting  that  the  Timber

In  putting  together  this  issue,  we struggled with nomenclature surrounding the Timber Wars. Even the term 'Timber Wars' was a subject of discussion. Some authors capitalized the term, some did not. Some used

Even  within  this  limited  regional view, the Timber Wars were multifaceted and varied according to geography and landownership  characteristics.  In  most  places,  the Timber Wars were associated with federal land management, particularly the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management, and the development of the Northwest Forest Plan to maintain habitat for a host of species, most famously the northern spotted owl habitat ( Strix occidentalis caurina ). In some places, like the redwood region of Northern California, the Timber Wars also occurred on private lands. Though there were many similarities, such as the focus on oldgrowth forest protection and forest workers' livelihoods, strategies of opposition and resistance - from both sides - were very different. Others have written extensive histories of these battles. 1 So, while including some historical perspectives, we do not attempt to rehash the full scope of the historical Timber Wars.

Speece, Darren. 2016. Defending Giants: The Redwood Wars and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics. Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press.

isputes between the timber industry, public forest land managers, federal and state  regulatory  agencies, and environmental groups from  the  1980s  through the early 2000s resulted in polarization and distrust  across  forest  communities  of  the American West. These 'Timber Wars' centered on the conservation of old-growth forests and biodiversity, and the declining socioeconomic status of many timber-dependent communities.  The  disputes  were  complex, with arguments over values, identity, and environmental governance. They involved legal, cultural, discursive, and at times violent battles between adversaries. For this issue of the Humboldt  Journal  of  Social  Relations (HJSR), we explore the dynamics of the postTimber War American West and how communities and stakeholders have forged ways to diversify their economies and have, often collaboratively, worked to find compromise and face newly-emerging challenges of forest land management. D

Wars were 'over,' though that claim itself is contentious.  Certainly,  national  headlines about the Timber Wars have disappeared; we no longer have U.S. presidential candidates debating the topic. Other natural resource and land management issues have become more prominent,  shifting  the  public's  attention away from forests. Meanwhile, managers of both private and public forest lands across the region have mostly ended old-growth logging -  whether  because  most  remaining  oldgrowth forests are in protected areas or because they no longer exist - with important social, economic, political, and cultural impacts for the region's people. But disputes linger over forest management, as many of these articles suggest.

## The  American  West  after  the  Timber Wars: Collected Articles

While the Timber Wars were largely over natural resource management, this special issue of HJSR focuses not on the forests but on the people involved in the disputes and involved in repairing relationships after the disputes. The articles are a mix of traditional academic discussions and more personal 'Vantage Points.'

## Vantage Points

The issue begins with Vantage Points, which  were  submitted  by  forest  managers and activists. Our first four articles focus on the Timber Wars particular to the redwood region  of  Northern  California,  where  the Timber Wars have mostly been about private lands management. In particular, the Timber Wars of this region centered on the Pacific Lumber  Company  and  its  takeover  by Maxxam,  which  transformed  the  formerly family-held company and its forestry practices, shifting from a conservative harvesting model to one of debt-driven overharvesting. Greg King, an activist who helped lead the

opposition to Maxxam, asserts that the Timber Wars never existed. Rather, he argues that what others called the 'Timber Wars' were a one-sided attack on environmentalists who were trying to get state agencies to enforce the law. Richard Gienger, a renowned watershed restorationist in the region, reviews his history of working with, against, and in spite of state regulators, up to the present day. He ends with examples that reflect tentative optimism, a 'hope' and a 'last chance' for private forest management in the state. Former Director  of  California  Department  of  Forestry Andrea Tuttle, in an interview with Erin Kelly, reflects from a state  policy maker's perspective on the political struggles to regulate private forest management, from voter initiatives  to  legislation  to  administrative rule-making. She notes that, over the years, California  forest  management  regulations have been changed substantially as a result of difficult negotiations and compromises on all sides. Finally, Mike Miles, a forester with Humboldt Redwood Company, looks at the emerging approaches to conservation on private lands today, in an era when private landowners seek social license.

In addition, two Vantage Point articles address public lands forest management. Shiloh and Johnny Sundstrom write about the Siuslaw National Forest in Oregon, where they worked with partners to build a new type of  stewardship  relationship between public lands management agencies and local communities. Diana Portner reflects on the collaborative efforts on the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, where diverse stakeholders have  forged  common  ground  despite  the USFS still harvesting old-growth timber on the Forest.

## Articles

The  academic  articles  in  this  issue span geographies and topics. They are impressively multi-disciplinary, with scholars

from fields including geography, anthropology, economics, and sociology. This variety reflects the long-standing interest from social scientists  regarding forest management and forest communities. In this section, we start with  a  history  from  Jennifer  Bernstein providing an overview of the events and negotiations that led to the creation of the Headwaters  Forest  Reserve,  with  perspectives from three local leaders.

Mark Haggerty tackles the complex issue of compensation to counties with large federal land holdings, beginning with County Payments from the early 20 th century to Payments in Lieu of Taxes in the 1970s through the Rural Schools Act after the Timber Wars. He proposes an alternative approach, a new endowment-based model akin to state trust funds that would buffer the uncertainty of annual  receipts  tied  to  income  from  federal lands for county expenses such as roads and schools. In a piece spanning work conducted over forty years, Carol Colfer revisits two communities on Puget Sound, Washington, in  order  to  explore  social  and  cultural

Several authors address social change in communities in the wake of the Timber Wars, marked by decline in the timber industry and struggles  in forest communities  to maintain infrastructure and economic wellbeing.  Timothy  Inman,  Hannah  Gosnell, Denise Lach, and Kailey Kornhauser explore changes to the timber industry, landscape, and  demographics  of  communities  in  the foothills of the Oregon Cascades. They conclude  with  recommendations  to  improve community resilience and adaptive capacity. Yvonne Everett presents a case of a relatively new natural resource-based economy: that of the cannabis economy of Northern California. She outlines the perspectives of community-based organization leaders  in Northern California  (who  helped  the  transition from timber-based management to forest restoration)  as they address  the challenges arising from the cannabis boom.

changes and profound transformations in local economies and gender relations. She proposes implications from her findings for the efforts of public  forest land managers who are increasingly engaging with communities in collaborative processes.

The final two articles are both comparative case study pieces that analyze components  of  public  lands  collaborative  processes  and governance. In their papers on power (Patricia Orth and Antony Cheng) and trust (Emily Jane Davis, Lee Cerveny, Donald Ulrich, and Megan Nuss), the authors disassemble difficult concepts to focus on their component parts. Orth and Cheng focus on how internal power dynamics and the application of power can differ from one collaborative process to the next. Their findings suggest  that,  while  power  imbalances  can  be problematic, they can also be addressed. Davis, Cerveny, Ulrich, and Nuss help to clarify the 'jumbled' concept of trust and how it functions  within  collaborative  processes. While the authors point out that trust can be an important outcome of collaboration, they

This provides a segue to the next set of articles, which directly address the shifting institutional and governance arrangements of public  lands  management,  wherein  federal agencies have developed partnerships with diverse stakeholders in forest communities in efforts to improve forest management and contribute to local economies. Erin Kelly describes the role of one community group in Northern California that is working with federal agencies to steward public forests in the context of declining agency capacity. Leanna Weissberg, Jonathan Kusel, and Kyle Rodgers  identify community priorities regarding forest management and community well-being for residents in California's Sierra Nevada.  They then describe several stages of collaborative  processes  in  the  region  that have evolved to address forest health and 'renew' the connections between the USFS and nearby communities.

also look into the impacts of trust and distrust on achieving the objectives of forest collabo- ratives.

Despite the wide range of topics, ge- ographies  and  points  of  view  represented here, the authors weave a rich tapestry of voices that reinforce one another as they de- scribe changing forest management and com- munity  well-being  after  the  Timber  Wars. Many cautiously point to the emergence of better forest practices, an emphasis on resto- ration and sustainable forestry, and increased collaboration  among  stakeholders,  with  a greater voice for local communities. While there will be many challenges ahead for for- ests  and  forest  communities,  perhaps  the evolving adaptive institutional structures de- scribed here will help to ensure greater resil- ience in the years to come. And perhaps as well, those involved in looming natural re- source and land management wars - whether over water, energy extraction, mining, or can- nabis - can learn from the difficult lessons of the Timber Wars of the American West.",5,"The given passage is detailed and specific about the locations and regions where the Timber Wars, primarily a conflict centered on the management of timber resources and old-growth forests, occurred. It clearly distinguishes different fronts of the Timber Wars, notably ones on private lands in Northern California especially concerning the Pacific Lumber Company and Maxxam, and those on public federal lands managed by entities like the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. The details provided within the context explicitly answer the question about where the Timber Wars were focused on private lands, making the response unambiguous and detailed specific to both the geographic region and the historical context of the conflict on these lands. The variety in perspectives (Vantage Points) provided by actual participants in these conflicts, ranging from activists to forrestry managers, further corroborates the intricacies and regions of these disputes.",5,"The question pertains to a specific historical event, the Timber Wars, which had significant implications for the private lands management in a certain region of California, including Humboldt County which is part of the Redwood Empire and is heavily associated with its timber industry. This question, therefore, has direct relevance to the historical and economic context of Humboldt County.",5,"The Timber Wars primarily focused on private lands management in Humboldt County, which is located in Northern California. The question implicitly refers to this specific region by mentioning the 'Timber Wars' and does not depend on additional context familiar only to insiders or specialists; anyone with general knowledge about American environmental history could understand this reference. Therefore, the question is largely self-contained, making it a 5 on the scale of context-independence.","The Timber Wars primarily concerned the management of private lands in Northern California, particularly in Humboldt and Mendocino Counties.

## Community Composition on Logs and Ground

<!-- image -->

## INTRODUCTION

Fallen trees, or nurse logs, are important features in forest ecosystems that can provide diverse wildlife habitat, substrate for vascular and nonvascular plants, and be a crucial mechanism in energy flow and nutrient cycling (Harmon et al. 1986).

Sustainable forest management has been a growing focus of recent decades in the Pacific Northwest redwood forests, and nurse logs could be an important tool in maintaining these healthy stands (Andre 2015).

I hypothesized that nurse logs were an important feature that should be included in healthy forest management because they promoted vascular plant heterogeneity in the forest habitat.

## METHODS

I gathered data hiking along the trails in the Arcata Community Forest, located in Humboldt County, CA during the months of February to March 2022.  I used a half meter quadrat on log and ground plots where I recorded data on all species present, number of individuals, and percent of cover for each species. For logs I also collected diameter and length measurements. Ground plots were located 1 meter away from the center of the logs.

I conducted paired t-tests to compare the species richness, abundance, and plant coverage between ground and log plots. I also did an MDS and PERMANOVA analysis to address the differences in community structure between plots.

## RESULTS

Based on my MDS and PERMANOVA analysis, vascular plant communities differed on logs and the ground (Pseudo-F 1,105 = 4.39, P = 0.0009). I found that species richness did not differ significantly between log and ground plots ( t 54 = 0.21, P = 0.83). I also determined that total plant coverage and abundance was not significantly different between log and ground plots ( t 54 = 1.24, P = 0.22 & t 54 = 1.98, P = 0.052).

## DISCUSSION

Simple metrics analysis did not show a significant difference between ground and log plots in terms of species richness, plant coverage, or abundance. I did find a difference, however, in the overall structures of vascular plant communities on logs and the ground through further analysis.

My hypothesis was supported that logs are home to a different habitat compared to the floor  of the redwood forest. Logs provided a different habitat in the ecosystem, with potentially different substrate characteristics, light levels, less competition, and protection from herbivores (Harmon et al. 1986). I would recommend that some downed logs are left on the forest floor to promote health and heterogeneity in our forest.

This demonstrates a high relevance to documenting biological observations specific to Humboldt County.",4,"The question refers to a specific location (Arcata Community Forest) and specific biological findings (species of vascular plants on nurse logs and ground plots), and while the reference to 'Arcata Community Forest' provides context about the location, the nature of the question is clear and self-contained regarding its botanical focus, making it less dependent on additional context for comprehension.","According to the study, **74 vascular plant species** were identified on nurse logs and ground plots in the Arcata Community Forest."

## Connecting Care: Advancing Diabetes Management in Rural Areas Through Telehealth and Community  Empowerment

## Reality

## Background

Challenges in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in rural areas due to inadequate healthcare resources and access.

Diabetes requires ongoing care and self -management, which in rural areas, access to resources can pose significant challenges.

Geographical isolation, transportation to healthcare facilities, shortages of healthcare professionals and specialized care providers, socioeconomic challenges, limited bilingual access.

## Importance of Issue

- ❖ Proper management reduces severe complications and improves life quality of patients
- ❖ Improved management significantly reduces healthcare expenses and enhances overall community health
- ❖ Empowering nurses to assume leadership roles in the management of chronic diseases like T2D and broadens their skills especially through telehealth

## Framework

## Klamath Dam Removal

Contributors: Oden Taylor, Jillian Wells, Emma Wilson, and Gabriel Zucker Faculty Advisor: Jessie Cretser-Hartenstein

## Introduction

The Klamath Dam removal project is a significant initiative for Indigenous land restoration. Four dams (Copco 1, Copco 2, Iron Gate, & John C. Boyle) on the Klamath River have obstructed the natural flow of water and harmed ecosystems and native species like the sacred Chinook Salmon.

This research utilizes quantitative methodology to examine local news coverage of the dam removal project by three prominent media outlets in Humboldt County, California in order to identify the amount of coverage this project has received, how the narrative has been framed, and which stories are being told.

<!-- image -->

## Methodology

- Content analysis was used to analyze news articles focusing on Klamath Dam coverage from Lost Coast Outpost , North Coast Journal , and Times-Standard throughout the one-year period following the announcement of the dam removal (November 2022 -November 2023).
- A coding sheet was applied to each article, which identified key words and overarching themes.
- Articles were categorized by theme/topic (e.g. policy, deconstruction, indigenous, tribes, fish & wildlife, environment, legislation, restoration, etc) . This helped to identify trends in coverage, language, tone, and theme.
- Numerical data was analyzed and descriptive statistics applied.

## Results

<!-- image -->

North Coast Journal had the least frequency of coverage of the Klamath dam removal with 8 total articles (note that this is a weekly publication with long-form reporting).

Times-Standard was second with 13 articles (note that this is a daily publication with some syndicated AP content).

Lost Coast Outpost had the most frequency of coverage with 19 articles (note that this is an online publication with varied content including press releases and videos).

The most common words used across all three publications were: River, Klamath, Salmon, Water, Fish, Dam(s), Removal, and Tribes

The least common words found across all publications in total were: Legislation, Policy, Indigenous, Condor, and Lake.

## data

## Discussion

The North Coast Journal had the lowest overall coverage, but had high percentages of words such as Yurok (23.5%), Salmon (23.5%), and Klamath (23.5%), indicating coverage that focuses on themes such as Indigenous peoples and fish & wildlife. Times-Standard primarily focused on themes of policy and the environment, with high percentages of keywords such as Klamath (12.7%), River (12.7%), California (11.4%), and Removal (8.9%). Lost Coast Outpost led in overall coverage, with high percentages of keywords such as Yurok (26.2%), Tribe (19%), Restoration (9.5%), and River (9.5%), indicating that they primarily cover the Klamath Dam with the themes of indigenous/tribes and the environment.

Our findings indicate a predominant emphasis on the Yurok Tribe in local coverage, with minimal attention given to the crucial aspect of food sovereignty despite it being a primary motivation for the dam removal.

## Conclusion

Accurate and well-researched reporting fosters meaningful dialog among community members and decision-makers about the complex issues surrounding dam removal efforts. Media research can assist journalists in framing the Klamath dam removal project within wider environmental, legal, and social contexts. By examining and including indigenous perspectives, historical data, legal documents, scientific studies, and community responses in reporting, journalists can offer readers a nuanced view of the project's impact and significance.

Limitations: This study utilizes a relatively small sample size among local publications in Humboldt County. Further research could analyze more diverse news outlets and compare coverage from non-local sources.

## Investigation into Cyanide Levels at the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility

Danny Brown, Jack McLaughlin and Matthew Hurst

Department of Chemistry, Cal Poly Humboldt, Arcata CA 95521

## Methods

Samples were collected on October 20th and 27th, November 17th, and December 15th in 2021 concurrently with routine monitoring of cyanide. Preserved and unpreserved wastewater effluent samples were collected from Outfall 001. An additional unpreserved sample was spiked with 15 pg/L to determine whether the sample integrity was maintained over the course of the analysis. Samples were taken to Cal Poly Humboldt (CPH) where they were distilled following Standard Method 4500C for cyanide and the concentration was analyzed immediately using an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer and Standard Method 4500E; a 10 cm quartz-windowed sample cell was used to achieve sufficient sensitivity at detection limits near 0.5 pg/L. Over the course of three months, laboratory control samples spiked with 5 pg/L cyanide were used to establish a method detection limit and bias. All results from CPH were compared to the results from a certified lab where the analysis was performed within the 14-day holding time allowed by EPA protocols.

## Abstract

The City of Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility (AWTF) was issued a new National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit in 2019, which establishes a water quality objective for cyanide of 1.0 gg/L for the protection of saltwater aquatic life. Since the enactment of the permit, the AWTF has been over the maximum daily effluent limit (MDEL) of 1.0 gg/L and average monthly effluent limit (AMEL) of 0.43 μg/L for cyanide in discharged effluent. However, results show that the concentration of cyanide in the wastewater leaving the plant is on average greater than those measured in the plant influent. This study used distillation and colorimetric analysis to investigate the cyanide formation within the AWTF by comparing the cyanide levels in preserved and unpreserved samples. Samples were taken concurrently with the monitoring samples that were sent to a certified lab. The study, which had an estimated method detection limit (MDL) of 0.55 μg/L, found that unpreserved samples had no detectable levels of cyanide while preserved samples demonstrated a cyanide concentration ranging from no detection to 1.7 gg/L. Results for preserved samples in this study compared well with those from the certified lab, however, the value from our study were consistently lower for each sampling event. The use of field spikes demonstrated that the integrity of the sample was maintained in unpreserved samples. The elevated cyanide levels in preserved samples compared to unpreserved samples suggest that preservation with sodium hydroxide (pH > 12) leads to a positive interference in the analysis.

## Objective

Since using a new method to detect low-level concentrations of cyanide, all samples being sent to a certified laboratory have reported cyanide concentration above the AMEL in discharged effluent to Humboldt Bay on a regular basis, triggering accelerated monitoring requirements and fines. This was presumed to be due to cyanide formation in the wetlands, positive interferences caused by the wastewater sample matrix, or with the new analytical methodology. The objective of this study was to determine the source of the cyanide in the plant effluent by performing on­ site analysis for cyanide at Cal Poly Humboldt, which was used to determine whether the preservation method for the cyanide test was causing false positives in plant effluent (Outfall 001). The cyanide results from the on-site analysis of unpreserved and preserved samples were compared to results from a certified laboratory.

<!-- image -->

## Results

For each sampling event, the cyanide concentrations in both the unpreserved and preserved samples from Outfall 001 were analyzed to ascertain whether or not there was an issue with sample preservation method or analysis. As seen below, Figure 2 displays the overlay of spectra for representative standards, a method blank, and samples (preserved and unpreserved).

The MDL reported by a certified lab was 0.70 ug/L, which was similar to the MDL of 0.55 ug/L estimated in this study. The bias of each group's results were calculated using their LCS and LCSD results. Bias calculated for CPH using seven replicate standards was -6%, whereas bias calculated from the certified lab results was +7%.

This study found that there was no detectable amount of cyanide in unpreserved samples during any of the sampling events. Preserved samples that were analyzed 72 hours later showed measurable cyanide during three of the four sampling events. The certified lab found cyanide concentrations exceeding the MDEL of 1.0 ug/L in each of the sampling events. Similar trends were seen by both groups as cyanide concentrations decreased over the testing period, however, certified lab results were consistently higher than CPH results. The results for cyanide concentration in the various samples, by both groups, are listed below in Table 3.

## Conclusion

It was determined that the unpreserved wastewater samples collected and analyzed immediately (within 15 minutes) showed no detectable levels of cyanide. Furthermore, the preservation of the sample with sodium hydroxide was shown to produce a false positive for cyanide at low-level reporting limits analyzed after 3 days. The results were found to be highly dependent on the analyst and the distillation set-up.

In future work, a lower cyanide concentration should be used in field spikes when determining whether the sample integrity of unpreserved samples is maintained. Lastly, the method detection limit for the analysis of cyanide at CPH should be further developed in order to define the reporting limit.

This study provides evidence that there is an issue with the sampling procedure for cyanide required by the NPDES permit. The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board have reviewed these findings and it is allowing the City of Arcata to preform a holding time study to show that the analysis of cyanide at AWTF can be performed using unpreserved samples.

## Aprender a Vivir Emmanuel Caro Montoya

The kids in my class are talking to me. 'No les entiendo'. Es otro idioma diferente.

En mi casa nomás se habla español, nada de inglés.

Quiero aprender inglés, ya aprendí el idioma, ahora, puedo hablar con mis compañeros de clase.

Mis padres me hablan, 'What are they saying?' Did I forget how to speak Spanish? I can't communicate with my own parents. I'm annoyed, Frustrated.

¿Por qué no nos hablas hijo? ¿No sabes qué decir?

I'm going to learn Spanish, so I can communicate with them again.",5,"The context describes a bilingual person's difficulty in communicating with their Spanish-speaking family after learning English. It clearly highlights the person's struggle with language usage affecting their personal relationship and their determination to bridge this gap by learning Spanish again. So, the question about the reason behind not speaking to their parents in Spanish is answerable unambiguously.",5,"The question asks for a list of landmarks in Humboldt County, which provides direct information valuable for tourists, researchers, or anyone interested in the geographical and cultural heritage of Humboldt County. This is clearly relevant to information about documents related to Humboldt County as it pertains to its significant places and potential records about those landmarks, such as historical archives or preservation documents.",5,"The question refers to the purpose of eating breakfast, but the reason (“to set your metabolism”) is provided in the question itself, making it self-explanatory and independent of external context. It doesn't depend on understanding specific nutritional facts or personal experiences regarding metabolism.","The 2010 United States Census found that Humboldt County, California had a population of 132,371, ranked 684th most populous county in the U.S. Its biggest city is Eureka. It is known for its redwood forests, rugged coastline, and sustainable living practices. The county report highlights its rich cultural and environmental diversity."

## True North: Charting A New Tomorrow

C ommunity  leaders  formed  True  North  Organizing Network (TNON) to unite in the struggle for justice and equity. /T\_heir approach creates connections between individuals  and  establishes  a  foundation  for  community organizing at the grassroots level. According to their website, 'True  North  Organizing  Network  supports  families,  elders and youth of diverse faith traditions, ethnicities, cultures, and economic capacities-using the power of relationships and a disciplined  community  organizing  model-to  courageously challenge social, economic and environmental injustice in our region.' TNON, commonly referred to as True North, began under the Humboldt Area Foundation and the Wild Rivers Foundation. /T\_hey now operate as an independent nonpro/fit organization, encompassing Humboldt, Del Norte, and tribal lands throughout the Redwood region.

/T\_he name True North originated in early meetings when people remarked to current Executive Director Terry Supahan that there was an unseen, overlooked part of northern California, a place 'north of even Sacramento, the true north of California.' /T\_he name stuck, and True North has evolved as a multi-faith, multi-race, social justice organization that serves the community through values of inclusivity and love. Supahan shared one of True North's most important interview questions for new community organizers: 'Who do you love?' A few moments later, he provided

20

his own answer: 'Everyone. People who don't look like us, think like us, /v.altote like us. We don't get to pick and choose who we love.'

True  North  took  inspiration  from  the  Paci/fic  Institute for  Community  Organizations  (PICO)  National  Network (now called Faith in Action) and modeled their organization around building relationships with individuals. 'At the heart of this organizing model is one-to-one relationship building and building power through those relationships,' Supahan said. He also noted that students 'bring new life' into the organization and have been a part of True North since its inception. For instance, in 2016, True North supported students who traveled to Standing Rock to help Indigenous communities defend the land against the Dakota Access Pipeline project.

True  North  continues  its  dedication  to  students  by participating as a placement site for students in communitybased  learning  courses.  Graciela  Leal,  majoring  in  political science with a concentration in public policy, is helping with activities such as immigration event planning, vaccine clinics, and the National Catholic Action for Citizenship. Evan Morden interned last year with TNON while working on his sociology master's  thesis  in  social  power  and  community  organizing. Morden is now a True North Community Organizer in training.

Morden's  early  projects  involved  researching  political candidates  during  a  city  council  election  and  collecting

information on them. He also researched housing, funding for housing, and emergency shelter programs in Humboldt County.  He  described  his  time  interning  at  TNON  as transformative and re/flected upon his initial goals to complete a degree in criminology and then pursue a career as a police o/fficer. 'I wanted to be there for people in their worst moments. I learned that not everyone had the same experience with law enforcement, and I became interested in how to solve the root causes of social injustice instead of treating symptoms with punishment.' He later stated, 'We are looking for leadership in our community from ordinary people who don't know that they have a voice.'

True  North  facilitates  opportunities  for  community members to take action towards equity and social justice. /T\_hey help put power back into the hands of the community and show the impact of what can get done through collective action. Leal explained that serving with True North 'really did help give me a perspective on how people organize, the di/fferent dynamics of power, and how we can use a collection of people to get something done.' Leal's experience shows how organizations like Truth North are invaluable platforms that help make local grassroots community organizing more accessible.

At  the  start  of  student  internships  with  TNON, supervisors ask interns to write their 'Political Autobiography,'' where they chronicle what factors in their lives drew them to social justice. Director of Organizing Julia Lerma, who has been with True North since 2011 as a mentor, described the beginnings of the internship as a 'baptism by /fire,' in which students  are  encouraged  to  exercise  their  leadership  skills and take the initiative on projects. 'If students are going to work in our organization and work with our leaders, it's really important that they understand our process. And they also

need to understand why they want to do this work… So we start out with a Political Autobiography, which means they get to dig into what in their life story has brought them to social justice.'

Loren Collins, an HSU faculty member who oversees the Political Science Internship course where students o/f\_ten partner with TNON, had nothing but accolades for True North. He described the organization as 'a rare gem that brings community organizing, activism, and very concrete political action together into one place.' Collins regarded True North's work with HSU interns as 'building the community leaders of tomorrow.'

True North currently focuses on vaccine clinics, immigration  reform,  and  collaborations  with  community faith  leaders,  among  many  other  active  projects.  Supahan acknowledged that community organizing is challenging and may  feel  more  like  tug-of-war  than  pulling  people  together. However,  sometimes  a  community  needs  to  work  through challenges together to /fight for what they believe is right. 'I love the /fight, no matter what. Even if it doesn't go well, I think we're moving for things that can make things better. I love them all. I love the whole damn thing!' Supahan said.

## How the Pandemic Handed Me My Bachelor's Degree

## Cheri Anchondo

England Is Their Cup of Tea: Cheri and her daughter Olivia at the Tower of London in September 2018.

<!-- image -->

I am a single parent of a special needs immunecompromised child, a full-time employee of E&J Gallo Winery in Modesto, California, and a returningand now graduate!-Humboldt State Lumberjack. I started my journey toward a double major in Geography and Dance Studies in the spring of 2006. In passionate pursuit of both majors, I proudly represented HSU on stage at American College Dance Association, on tour in Spain, and as a student-geographer at annual California Geographical Society meetings.

I was on target to graduate in the spring of 2009, but by then had exhausted my f inancial aid. Though working full time, I no longer could afford to continue living in Humboldt County and wait until the following spring to enroll full-time for the additional seven units required to complete an undergraduate education at

HSU. Therefore, I moved back home with the intention of f inishing my bachelor's degree at a later point in my life.

As more time passed, the more distant that possibility seemed.

Living 358 miles away from HSU presented the f irst obstacle. Finances another. Also, I became a single parent, the sole provider for my child. My priorities shifted. Throughout the years, I inquired into how I might f inish my degree. However, attending a local California State University requires residency (meaning additional units). And not all HSU units I earned transfer because not all CSUs are the same. Thankfully, my employer values higher education. I received critical support from

managers, supervisors, and coworkers. For years, they encouraged me to make calls and send emails. So I kept at it, every few months contacting various o ff ices at Humboldt and asking how I could f inish up, hoping the answer would somehow change.

Enter COVID-19.

I last inquired in January 2020. Per usual, there was not much hope. In March-April 2020, as news broke that universities were transitioning to full online delivery, I found the courage to send one more email and make another round of calls, asking if the courses I needed would be available online. The opportunity to complete my degree arrived as a con f luence of luck, a pandemic forcing widespread online instruction, employment at a company providing me with the equipment to work

remotely, and a tuition reimbursement program. It also involved HSU's O ff ice of Extended Education,

the Registrar, and the chairs of two departments-Geography, Environment, and Spatial Analysis and Theater, Film, and Dance-all saying, 'We can work this out.'

F ortunately, I was able to capitalize on the moment, completing three units during the summer and four units during the fall of 2020, f inally earning my double-major bachelor's of arts!

Finishing my bachelor's degree has been an incredible bright spot for

me during the pandemic. If not for COVID-19, I may never have completed my BA. I am grateful for the online infrastructure and support systems that made it possible. I am also thrilled to be able to model success in the face

Quarantine has taught me so much

about being present, being grateful for good health, opportunities to travel, learn, and connect with other humans. Most of all, this strange time in history has taught me to take moments as they happen, never quit, gather myself and coil my strength so I can spring forward. The pandemic has taught me never to give up-it is never too late to try again. My ultimate hope

is that others like me will also be able to return and f inish what they started, that HSU will reimagine access to higher education and retain the online options for students with stories like mine.

## COVID-19 Gave Me a Second Chance

## Erendira 'Elly' Hernandez

A lthough a little embarrassed, I feel the need to tell my story. It may contain a huge lesson for other people. Furthermore, it is probably one of the few good things resulting from the pandemic.

I started attending Humboldt State University in the fall of 2011 and 'graduated' in fall 2016. I walked the stage a semester early because I discovered if you do not graduate in May you do not get to walk on stage and my family wanted to see me walk on stage and celebrate graduation with me. The following semester, I thought I had completed the f inal requirements for my bachelor's degree. My family and friends were so proud of me. As a f irst-generation Guatemalan-American, I managed to be the f irst person in my family to graduate college. And I did it while working, being a full-time student, and raising my daughter as a single mother.
